Influence of religion in crime rates and political parties in US electorade.
The idea of this little research is to see if there is any correlation between the religiosity of a state and its preference to a certain political party and also with its crime rates. Therefore, the region of study is limited to the Region of United States of America (The country) by states.

Datasets: I found different sources of data related with religion, politics demographic and finally, crime rates. It is important to mention that I did'nt found this tables extremely accurate (in my opinion) since there are factors that are similar and do not match each other in a significant way when I consider they should.
